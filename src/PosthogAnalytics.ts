/* Posthog analytics tracking.
 *
 * Anonymity behaviour is as follows:
 *
 * - If Posthog isn't configured in `config.json`, events are not sent.
 * - If [Do Not Track](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/doNotTrack) is
 *   enabled, events are not sent (this detection is built into posthog and turned on via the
 *   `respect_dnt` flag being passed to `posthog.init`).
 * - If the `feature_pseudonymous_analytics_opt_in` labs flag is `true`, track pseudonomously by maintaining
 *   a randomised analytics ID in account_data for that user (shared between devices) and sending it to posthog to
     identify the user.
 * - Otherwise, if the existing `analyticsOptIn` flag is `true`, track anonymously, i.e. do not identify the user
     using any identifier that would be consistent across devices.
 * - If both flags are false or not set, events are not sent.
