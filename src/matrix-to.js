    // These servers are called "candidates" at this point because
    // it is unclear whether they are going to be useful to actually
    // join in the future.
    //
    // We pick 3 servers based on the following criteria:
    //
    //   Server 1: The highest power level user in the room, provided
    //   they are at least PL 50. We don't calculate "what is a moderator"
    //   here because it is less relevant for the vast majority of rooms.
    //   We also want to ensure that we get an admin or high-ranking mod
    //   as they are less likely to leave the room. If no user happens
    //   to meet this criteria, we'll pick the most popular server in the
    //   room.
    //
    //   Server 2: The next most popular server in the room (in user
    //   distribution). This cannot be the same as Server 1. If no other
    //   servers are available then we'll only return Server 1.
    //
    //   Server 3: The next most popular server by user distribution. This
    //   has the same rules as Server 2, with the added exception that it
    //   must be unique from Server 1 and 2.

    // Rationale for popular servers: It's hard to get rid of people when
    // they keep flocking in from a particular server. Sure, the server could
    // be ACL'd in the future or for some reason be evicted from the room
    // however an event like that is unlikely the larger the room gets.

    // Note: we don't pick the server the room was created on because the
    // homeserver should already be using that server as a last ditch attempt
    // and there's less of a guarantee that the server is a resident server.
    // Instead, we actively figure out which servers are likely to be residents
    // in the future and try to use those.

    // Note: Users receiving permalinks that happen to have all 3 potential
    // servers fail them (in terms of joining) are somewhat expected to hunt
    // down the person who gave them the link to ask for a participating server.
    // The receiving user can then manually append the known-good server to
    // the list and magically have the link work.
