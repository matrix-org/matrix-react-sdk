 * An implementation of the "importance" algorithm for room list sorting. Where
 * the tag sorting algorithm does not interfere, rooms will be ordered into
 * categories of varying importance to the user. Alphabetical sorting does not
 * interfere with this algorithm, however manual ordering does.
 *
 * The importance of a room is defined by the kind of notifications, if any, are
 * present on the room. These are classified internally as Red, Grey, Bold, and
 * Idle. Red rooms have mentions, grey have unread messages, bold is a less noisy
 * version of grey, and idle means all activity has been seen by the user.
 *
 * The algorithm works by monitoring all room changes, including new messages in
 * tracked rooms, to determine if it needs a new category or different placement
 * within the same category. For more information, see the comments contained
 * within the class.
