                        You can use the custom server options to log into other Matrix
                        servers by specifying a different Home server URL.
                        <br/>
                        This allows you to use this app with an existing Matrix account on
                        a different Home server.

                        <br/>
                        You can also set a custom Identity server but this will affect
                        people&#39;s ability to find you if you use a server in a group other
                        than the main Matrix.org group.
