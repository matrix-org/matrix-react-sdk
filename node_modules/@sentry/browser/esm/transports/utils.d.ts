/**
 * A special usecase for incorrectly wrapped Fetch APIs in conjunction with ad-blockers.
 * Whenever someone wraps the Fetch API and returns the wrong promise chain,
 * this chain becomes orphaned and there is no possible way to capture it's rejections
 * other than allowing it bubble up to this very handler. eg.
 *
 * const f = window.fetch;
 * window.fetch = function () {
 *   const p = f.apply(this, arguments);
 *
 *   p.then(function() {
 *     console.log('hi.');
 *   });
 *
 *   return p;
 * }
 *
 * `p.then(function () { ... })` is producing a completely separate promise chain,
 * however, what's returned is `p` - the result of original `fetch` call.
 *
 * This mean, that whenever we use the Fetch API to send our own requests, _and_
 * some ad-blocker blocks it, this orphaned chain will _always_ reject,
 * effectively causing another event to be captured.
 * This makes a whole process become an infinite loop, which we need to somehow
 * deal with, and break it in one way or another.
 *
 * To deal with this issue, we are making sure that we _always_ use the real
 * browser Fetch API, instead of relying on what `window.fetch` exposes.
 * The only downside to this would be missing our own requests as breadcrumbs,
 * but because we are already not doing this, it should be just fine.
 *
 * Possible failed fetch error messages per-browser:
 *
 * Chrome:  Failed to fetch
 * Edge:    Failed to Fetch
 * Firefox: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource
 * Safari:  resource blocked by content blocker
