⚠️ NO LONGER MAINTAINED ⚠️

Please use [sindresorhus/github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) instead.

## Usage

```
npm install gfm.css
```

*..do whatever you're into, then..*

```html
<html>
...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/gfm.css">
...
<article class="markdown-body">
  <h1>rendered markdown content</h1>
  <p>wow</p>
</article>
...
</html>
```

All styles are scoped to `.markdown-body`, as on github.

### Sass

You can also use this as a [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) library.

```scss
@import '../node_modules/gfm.css/source/gfm.scss'
```

#### Bonus

You can take `gfm.scss` as a base set of styles and go bananas with your own style flavor. Note that you need to set any variables you want to override *before* the import statement. Here are all the defaults that can be overridden:

```scss
$gfm-body-font-size:      16px !default;
$gfm-code-font-size:      12px !default;
$gfm-body-color:          #333;
$gfm-link-color:          #4183c4;
$gfm-body-font-family:    'Helvetica Neue',
                          Helvetica,
                          'Segoe UI',
                          Arial,
                          freesans,
                          sans-serif !default;
$gfm-code-font-family:    Consolas,
                          'Liberation Mono',
                          Menlo,
                          Courier,
                          monospace !default;
$gfm-input-font-family:   Helvetica,
                          Arial,
                          freesans,
                          clean,
                          sans-serif,
                          'Segoe UI Emoji',
                          'Segoe UI Symbol' !default;
$gfm-header-font-family:  $gfm-body-font-family !default;
$gfm-header-border:       'true' !default;
```

### Extra
