    // In at least Firefox, the case of relative positioned inline elements
    // (such as mx_BaseAvatar) with absolute positioned children (such as
    // mx_BaseAvatar_initial) is a dark corner full of spider webs. It will give
    // different results during full reflow of the page vs. incremental reflow
    // of small portions. While that's surely a browser bug, we can avoid it by
    // using `inline-block` instead of the default `inline`.
